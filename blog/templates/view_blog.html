When teams participate in outdoor challenges, they learn to communicate effectively, strategize, and support one another, which translates into better teamwork back at the office. Moreover, outdoor activities promote physical health, reducing stress and increasing productivity. Companies that encourage outdoor engagement often see a boost in creativity and innovation, as employees return to work rejuvenated and inspired.
