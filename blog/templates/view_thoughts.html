    Soul:

In some corner of walls, 
I found my soul hanging.
At the top of mountain and hills,
I went and started screaming.

There was echo all around,
Then there, their voice I found.
I was still looking around,
To get something to be found.

I wish my soul to get free,
From that walls that hanged me.
Then I want to fly high and high,
Just like an eagle and butterfly.
