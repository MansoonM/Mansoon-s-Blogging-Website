      <h2 class="mb-3">Features in Detail</h2>
      <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Add and View Blogs</h3>
      <p>
        The core of Your Blogging Space is its blog feature. Adding a blog post is effortless: simply compose your thoughts in the editor, include titles, and publish for the community to explore.
        Your blogs can cover any topic you feel passionate about — from personal experiences, travel adventures, professional insights, technology reviews, artistic expressions, to life lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once published, your blog becomes accessible for others to read, comment on, and share.
        The platform supports browsing through fresh, popular, or topic-specific blogs so you can discover content that interests you.
        This creates a dynamic feed that fuels inspiration and learning.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Add and View Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes, you don’t need to write a long article — a brief moment of insight or inspiration can be just as powerful. Our “Thoughts” feature allows you to quickly jot down short reflections or ideas you want to share immediately.
        These bite-sized entries offer a different way to communicate, encouraging spontaneity and authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visitors to the platform can browse through these thoughts, gaining access to a quick stream of viewpoints, questions, or motivational phrases that spark creativity and connection.
        Thoughts complement blogs perfectly, creating a rich mix of content types for users to enjoy and contribute to.
